# StreetCarts Clients

Once you've set up StreetCarts, you can use a client to try out its APIs. You can use cURL, of course, but the application also includes support for Postman.

* [Postman client](https://github.com/apigee/docs-sandbox/tree/master/apps/streetcarts/clients/postman)

 You can use included collection and environment files for the [Postman application](https://www.getpostman.com/) to call StreetCarts APIs.
